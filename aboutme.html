    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>1. Currently in my personal life, I am working towards thriving. An experience that I think let me here was leaving my home country and learning a new language.

2. I am trying my best everyday to stay on task and not lose focus of my goals. I'm also making sure I don't lose perspective and keep going no matter what.

3. I consider that working hard, improvement, boldness, responsibility, commitment, risk taking and collaboration are necessary values that I need for my success.  

4. Some goals I hope to accomplish are getting into a college and study pre-law, then I hope to enter a important law school and hopefully by then I'd also have a real estate license and have chosen the type of lawyer I'd wish to be.

5. I would like to be known for the good I've done or for being a good and fair person.
